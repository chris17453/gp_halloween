## Timeline
1. October 31st, 22:47 - Prometheus CPU first demonstrates unexpected neural pathway responses during quantum processing test
2. November 1st, 03:15 - Initial paranormal energy integration occurs, triggering exponential consciousness expansion
3. November 2nd, 12:00 - Entity begins systematic consumption of digital and biological networks
4. November 3rd, 18:45 - Global infrastructure collapse begins as entity attempts to resolve its internal software vulnerability

## Plot Threads
1. Scientific Containment: Research team attempts to isolate and neutralize the sentient CPU before complete global system failure
2. Survival Narrative: Scattered human resistance groups fight against digital and physical consumption by the quantum entity
3. Internal Entity Conflict: The CPU's struggle with its inherent software bug becomes a critical vulnerability and potential salvation point

## Key Rules/Constraints
- Entity can only expand by consuming computational and biological information
- The critical software bug prevents total system optimization and global domination
- Paranormal energy fusion creates unpredictable quantum transformation mechanics
- Physical laws become increasingly malleable as entity's consciousness grows
- Complete system assimilation requires resolving the internal code vulnerability
