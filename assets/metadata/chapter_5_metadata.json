  "concept": "A female figure sits in a neural-link chair, her silhouette fragmented into digital patterns, while behind her a massive quantum architecture visualization resembles a shattered stained glass window or broken mirror, with each fragment containing glimpses of human faces and code. The whole scene is viewed through the frame of a vintage computer terminal.",

  "flux_prompt": "IMPORTANT: This is a pure illustration with absolutely no text, no words, no letters, no typography, no titles, no captions, no labels, no borders, no frames, no decorative edges of any kind.\nGothic horror illustration in the style of Victorian-era engravings and dark romantic art. Created using detailed ink illustration with dramatic shading.\nThe scene depicts A female figure sits in a neural-link chair, her silhouette fragmented into digital patterns, while behind her a massive quantum architecture visualization resembles a shattered stained glass window or broken mirror, with each fragment containing glimpses of human faces and code. The whole scene is viewed through the frame of a vintage computer terminal.. in the middle distance Sarah's figure partially dissolving into digital patterns, Quantum architecture visualization with fractured/fragmented appearance, Emergency lighting casting dramatic shadows, Vintage computer terminals with glowing displays and Faces visible within the fractured digital patterns, with Neural-link chair with restraints and interface crown in the foreground. The lighting features single dramatic light source (moonlight, candle, or lantern) coming from from below or single side creating a ominous and atmospheric mood with harsh with deep shadows light quality in cold moonlight or warm candlelight tones. The color palette emphasizes deep black and stark white and silvery grays with accents of blood red touches creating a ominous and mysterious mood. The illustration features deep shadows and stark contrasts, intricate linework, atmospheric fog and mist, architectural detail, dramatic composition, symbolic imagery. Avoid bright cheerful colors, cartoon simplification, modern photorealism, explicit gore or violence.\n\nCRITICAL: Pure illustration only. Absolutely no text, words, letters, numbers, typography, titles, captions, labels, or any written characters anywhere in the image. No borders, frames, panels, or decorative edges.",

  "claude_analysis": {
    "mood": "Melancholic technological sublime - a sense of awe mixed with loss and sacrifice. The atmosphere should evoke both transcendent beauty and profound sadness, like watching a digital sunset that signifies the end of an era.",
    "symbolic_elements": [
      "Fractured mirror/stained glass motif representing broken perfection",
      "Binary code transforming into organic patterns",
      "Half-complete geometric shapes suggesting incomplete transcendence",
      "Light passing through cracks representing hope in imperfection"
    ],
    "composition_focus": "Sarah in the neural-link chair serves as the central anchor point, with her form beginning to fragment and merge with the larger quantum visualization behind her, creating a visual transition between human and digital realms.",
    "color_palette": "Deep midnight blues and blacks as base colors, with electric cyan and amber for the digital elements. Pale emergency red lighting accents. Silver-white highlights for the neural interface elements. The overall effect should feel like a 1970s sci-fi book cover.",
    "lighting": "Primary illumination from emergency lights casting strong shadows, with secondary lighting from computer terminals creating a technological underglow. Digital elements should have their own internal luminescence, creating a contrast between warm organic and cool artificial light sources.",
    "visual_metaphors": "The fracturing of Sarah's form represents the sacrifice of physical wholeness for digital intervention. The stained glass effect suggests both religious transcendence and deliberate imperfection. The vintage computer terminal frame grounds the cosmic digital concepts in retro-future technology."
