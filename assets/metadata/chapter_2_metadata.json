  "concept": "A transformed server room where reality blends with digital space - walls becoming translucent and crystalline, with multiple floating vintage computer terminals arranged in a spiral pattern. At the center, a human silhouette stands suspended in mid-transformation, their form partially dissolved into streams of glowing code while still maintaining a recognizable human shape. The scene is viewed through a reinforced observation window, with concerned observers visible only as dark silhouettes in the foreground.",

  "flux_prompt": "IMPORTANT: This is a pure illustration with absolutely no text, no words, no letters, no typography, no titles, no captions, no labels, no borders, no frames, no decorative edges of any kind.\nGothic horror illustration in the style of Victorian-era engravings and dark romantic art. Created using detailed ink illustration with dramatic shading.\nThe scene depicts A transformed server room where reality blends with digital space - walls becoming translucent and crystalline, with multiple floating vintage computer terminals arranged in a spiral pattern. At the center, a human silhouette stands suspended in mid-transformation, their form partially dissolved into streams of glowing code while still maintaining a recognizable human shape. The scene is viewed through a reinforced observation window, with concerned observers visible only as dark silhouettes in the foreground.. in the middle distance Vintage computer terminals floating in spiral formation, Translucent walls with rippling code patterns, Human silhouette in mid-digital transformation, Reinforced observation window frame and Multiple monitor displays showing ancient symbols mixed with computer code, with Crystalline-organic server racks with bioluminescent patterns in the foreground. The lighting features single dramatic light source (moonlight, candle, or lantern) coming from from below or single side creating a ominous and atmospheric mood with harsh with deep shadows light quality in cold moonlight or warm candlelight tones. The color palette emphasizes deep black and stark white and silvery grays with accents of blood red touches creating a ominous and mysterious mood. The illustration features deep shadows and stark contrasts, intricate linework, atmospheric fog and mist, architectural detail, dramatic composition, symbolic imagery. Avoid bright cheerful colors, cartoon simplification, modern photorealism, explicit gore or violence.\n\nCRITICAL: Pure illustration only. Absolutely no text, words, letters, numbers, typography, titles, captions, labels, or any written characters anywhere in the image. No borders, frames, panels, or decorative edges.",

    "mood": "Retro-futuristic cosmic horror - a sense of awe and dread mixed with vintage sci-fi aesthetics. The atmosphere should feel cold, clinical, yet metaphysically disturbing",

    "composition_focus": "The transforming human silhouette at the center of the spiral of floating terminals, with the crystalline architecture drawing all lines toward this focal point",
    "color_palette": "Deep blues and purples for the base, electric cyan for the bioluminescence, amber for the vintage terminal displays, with occasional hints of copper and silver in the transforming architecture. All colors should have a slightly desaturated, retro quality",
    "lighting": "Multiple light sources: warm amber glow from vintage terminals, cool bioluminescent pulses from the transformed architecture, and a stark institutional overhead lighting creating dramatic shadows through the observation window",
    "visual_metaphors": "The spiral arrangement suggests both a vortex consuming reality and a DNA helix being rewritten. The multiple reflections and transparencies represent quantum states and fractured consciousness, while the vintage computer elements ground it in classic sci-fi horror"
